## Textbooks and lecture notes

### Recommended textbooks:

We will assign readings from the following textbooks. You do not need to buy them, https://github.com/mhjensen/Physics321/tree/master/doc/Literature, but they are good to have as a reference.

- JRT: [John R. Taylor, Classical Mechanics (Univ. Sci. Books 2005)](https://uscibooks.aip.org/books/classical-mechanics/)
- AMS: [Anders Malthe-SÃ¸renssen, Elementary Mechanics using Python (Springer 2015)](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319195957)

### Supplementary textbooks:

- MLB: [Mary L. Boas, Mathematical Methods in the Physical Sciences (Wiley 2005)](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Mathematical+Methods+in+the+Physical+Sciences%2C+3rd+Edition-p-9780471198260)

### Lectures: 

- Posted lecture notes are adapted from https://mhjensen.github.io/Physics321/doc/web/course.html. They are not meant to be a replacement for textbook readings and deeper research. These notes will be updated on a weekly basis to include pre-class lecture videos that might be useful.
- Handwritten lecture notes from class will be posted after each lecture. These notes will summarize the main sticking points and processes from each lecture. They will supplement the posted lecture notes and textbook readings.
- Videos of lecture will be posted on YouTube should you miss class, be ill, or otherwise need to review the prior lectures. These videos will be linked in the schedule as they are posted.
